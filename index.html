  <h2 class="mapChartTitle">Percent of Households With a Cell Phone in Each Wisconsin County</h2>
<p>Emergency management requires an understanding of the characteristics of which make up communities. For example, the map below shows the percent of households with a cellular device, according to 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data. When disasters are imminent or other alerts need to be communicated to the public, cellular alerts are a great way to reach people who need to be warned. Using the data below, we can see some counties have less households with a cellular device. This information may help a county emergency management office plan what other methods they can use to reach those populations without cellular devices. </p>  <!-- map and chart will be appended here by D3 -->
